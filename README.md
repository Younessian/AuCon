AuCon
AuCon is a lightweight Bash utility designed for network reconnaissance and domain resolution. It enables you to quickly resolve domains, process lists of subdomains, and scan CIDR ranges to find live IP addressesâ€”all from the command line.

Features
Domain Resolution: Quickly resolve a single domain's IP address with the -d flag.
Subdomain Processing: Process a file containing a list of subdomains with the -u option, removing duplicate entries.
Domains List Processing: Handle a list of domains from a file with the -l option.
CIDR Range Scanning: Scan a given CIDR range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) for live IP addresses using nmap with the -r option.
Simple Interface: A clear and concise help message guides you through usage.
Prerequisites
Bash Shell: AuCon is designed to run on Linux or any Unix-like system.
nmap: Required for scanning CIDR ranges. Install it using your package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install nmap).
